## About Tez:

Tez is a smartphone app specifically made for Indians to make the money transfer process simple. The app has been launched by Google collaborating with Govt of India. It simply lets sender transfer money to the receiver with their contact number alone which has been linked to bank account. It also lets users make their online money transfer in traditional ways. Also, it is not a wallet where user must credit the account with money before transfer/purchase, but it just manages everything with the linked bank account.

## Why Tez?
   I felt Tez as a game changer when it comes to money transfer. Tez has been launched in September 2017 and within 37 days it got 7.5 million installs. Money transfer system has been made very easy in India. The time it takes for whole transaction procedure is comparable to time normal SMS delivery services. Also, it uses UPI (Unified payment interface) which has been developed by National Payments Corporation of India. So not only the application is quick, it also is totally reliable. [1]

## Why Should someone use it?
*	Although there are many contemporary ways to do online transactions, I feel Tez is the best. The interface is so clear that even a first-time user can use it without any hustle. 
* 	The history of transactions is readily available for future references. 
*	Nowadays, Tez payment is accepted by many merchants which helps digitalization of developing country like India.
*	The is available in many local languages which encourages everyone to use it.
*	Apart from these, there are many rewards users can avail using this app. Government of India is sponsoring those.

## Combination of Technologies:
*	Unified Payments Interface – This is quick payment-system built by National Payments Corporation of India allowing inter-bank transactions [1]
*	Audio QR code technology – Inaudible sound waves are generated for temporary linkup between payer and merchant for quick transactions without exchanging any personal information. [1]


## Type of application
*	Productivity 

## Strengths and Weaknesses

*	Secure service is the biggest strength of this app.
*	 It has two-way authentication system. User must send an auto-message to bank and then only an OTP is sent by the bank.  I feel this as a weakness because if user wants to use this app in another headset than the one in which his SIM card is inserted.


## Improvements 
*	It is possible that user has more than one bank account linked to the same mobile number, in such case switching between bank accounts option is not available.
*	I feel security question should be asked before every transaction. As there are high chances that someone who knows the PIN (to enter the app) can use this effortlessly. 
*	The transactions are confined with in India. Allowing International transactions surely is going to be a great improvement. 


                            


## First Heuristic Evaluation: [Visibility of system status]
   I personally feel this app informs everything to the user. Even the first-time user will make no mistake if the user just follows the instructions properly. For every functionality, brief, common and proper keywords are used which lets any user know about the functionality. And appropriate feedback is given within no time. Every action is being informed with proper message along with simple graphics such that user is informed that something has happened. Proper colors are used to show if the action is succeeded.

## Second Heuristic Evaluation: [User control and freedom]
   I totally give positive evaluation for this Heuristic. User is given full control and freedom to navigate around while in the application. Back button is available in every functionality using which user can simply come back to “Home page” whenever necessary. I tried all functionalities and nowhere I faced any difficulty to navigate to homepage. 
 
## Second Application: [Photomath]
Link to application:  [https://photomath.net/en/](https://photomath.net/en/)

## About Photomath
   Photomath is a simple smart phone application which allows user to solve mathematical problems within fraction of seconds with the help of scanning. Unlike most of the other applications which use this scanning technique, it most of the times can scan handwritten equations if it is not a cacography. Besides the camera scanning ability, the user is provided an editor where user can enter his equations manually.

## Why Photomath?
  I felt this is very smart application that everyone should have in their smart phones. Our archaic calculator application only does basic math operations like additions, subtractions, multiplications etc... But Photomath solves quadratic equations, gives graphical sketches for equations, and does integrations and differentiations with one variable. 

## Why should someone use it?
 It is not necessary everyone on the planet is very good at solving problems. For such people this application is a savior. Even for people with good mathematical knowledge, it saves lots of time if they have some complex calculation to do. It also gives step-by-step instruction how the problem is solved. And flexibility to edit with the smart calculator is also given in case user wants to modify something.

## Combination of Technologies
*	Video Framing and Optical Character Recognition(OCR)
While scanning the mathematical problem, it internally generates number of consecutive video frame images and it combines all the OCR results of these consecutive images. [3]


## Type of application
*	Productivity/Education

Strengths and Weaknesses
*	Although is not designed for processing hand-written statements, it could process if the hand-writing is clear and good. 
*	It keeps the history of all the previous work done.
*	The application can pretty much solve any quadratic equation, but it will not work for equations which have order greater than TWO.
*	This will not work for equations with more than one variable.




## Improvements
*	For simple equation with two variables (say a line equation:  3y = 2x - 7), it cannot give proper graph. Although it is a very simple math equation.
*	In general, these kinds of apps are good to calculate bills such a functionality should be made available.


## First Heuristic Evaluation: [Aesthetic and minimalistic design]
   I personally used this app and I can guarantee that Aesthetic and minimalistic design heuristic is totally taken into consideration. The design is so plain and appealing with no unnecessary graphics and information whatsoever. For example, as shown in the figures, when I tried to see the graphs of the equations, I got simple graph which is very clear not raising any confusion. Also, the information given as “solving steps” is precise and perfect which can be easily understood by user.

## Second Heuristic Evaluation: [Help and documentation]
   Help and documentation are neatly provided in the app itself. User does not need to search for anything explicitly. All possible errors that could occur while using app are listed along with necessary solution or necessary information required. I personally gone through few common problems and the way they presented everything is very clear.
